This code provides experiments testing a universal framework for learning dynamics in deep neural networks.

The experiments compare results from an effective theory derived in the paper "When Representations Align: Universality in Representation Learning Dynamics" to learning dynamics of a range of different architectures and learned representational structures for different toy datasets. The notebooks for the experiments can be found in the "experiments" folder.
