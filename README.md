This code provides experiments testing a universal framework for learning dynamics in deep neural networks.

The experiments compare results from an effective theory derived in the paper "When Representations Align: Universality in Representation Learning Dynamics" to learning dynamics of a range of different architectures and learned representational structures for different toy datasets. Implementations of these experiments can be found in the "experiments" folder. Results will be saved in the "plots" folder. Required packages are listed in the "environment.yaml" file.

Note that the theoretical prediction for the XOR dataset (XOR.ipynb) requires the effective learning rates computed in the rich structure comparison (rich_structure.ipynb), which must be ran first.
